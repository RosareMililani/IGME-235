# Project 1 - Bubble Shoot & Pop
## I. High Concept

It’s Bust-A-Move but with an addition of avoiding/deflecting an NPC ghost.

## II. Genre

Casual & Strategy

## III. Platform

Available on desktop, phone, and tablet.

### IV. Story

 Your selected character is on a long-adventure traveling around the world and visiting the place. 
 Each stage/ level has a different unique bubble popping game. At the end of the stage, the character 
 faces a recurring enemy that will stop you from continuing on. This enemy throws particular items, 
 in which the character uses their shooting bubbles to beat the level and avoid being beaten by the 
 enemy. The storyline continues on while getting harder as you go through more levels. 

## V. Esthetics
-Graphic Style: Will have a cartoonish feel to the game, and the background is based on the stage you are on.
-Sound: The different sounds that will played are looped music regular level(slow casual sound), looped music 
enemy level (more upbeat sound), winning sound (beat level), losing sound (lose level), die from the enemy 
(attacked sound), collecting the new item (gained sound). 8-bit or casual background music during game and on
home screen.


## VI. Gameplay

-Mechanics: During the level of the game, the player can choose which direction they would like to shoot their bubble. At the enemy level, there will be a gauge that will start being filled up until max, in which the player can then attack the enemy, to lower enemies’ HP. Also, before beginning the game, they can choose power-ups that are available for the selected level. On the homepage of the map, they can choose levels, settings, go back to past stages, mini-task (maybe), and exit the game if needed. 
-Control: Mouse (Desktop)
	  Touch and gesture (Mobile)
-Onboarding: There will be an instruction screen that will show how to play the game. After completing the “tutorial” they can then proceed to the actual level of the game. The instructions screen will also pop up when a new power-up is introduced to the game.
-Player Learning: The player needs to learn the mechanics of the bubble. You need to connect the same colored bubbles to each other. Different colors will stick to the other surrounding color(s) until 2 more of the same color is attached, to “pop” off the color strand. There will be special power-ups that will be introduced into the game after a certain level/stage is reached. Defeating the enemy will have the same concept, but there will be a “dodging” concept that will be applied.
